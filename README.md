## Hi there I'm Vin ðŸ‘‹

  I am a software developer based in Auckland, New Zealand. My tech stacks primarily include JavaScript, HTML, CSS, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React, React Native,  Node.js, Express, FireBaseDB and SQLite3. 


-  Iâ€™m currently working on my photography portfolio page and a PSD file editor which are both pinned down below. The portfolio will serve as a personal portfolio for my photography to be showcased and the PSD Editor is a community tool that I am working on for my temple.

-  My other projects indclude [OOTD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IPF_3MQCrc), which is a React Native application for choosing daily outfits. It allows users to upload images of clothing items and randomly generates outfits at the click of a button. This outfit can also be posted to a feed which means the application is also a social media platform. Other mini projects include NightCap, which is an app that generates random cocktail recipes or gives you recipes when you search for cocktails by name. 

-  Iâ€™m currently learning and getting a better understanding of Node.js and deepening my knowledge on data structures and algorithms. I will also be sharpening up my python skills in the near future.
