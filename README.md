## Hi there I'm Vin ðŸ‘‹

  I am a software developer based in Auckland, New Zealand. My tech stacks primarily include JavaScript, HTML, CSS, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React, React Native,  Node.js, Express, FireBaseDB and SQLite3. 


-  Iâ€™m currently working on my photography portfolio page and a PSD file editor which are both pinned down below. The portfolio will serve as a personal portfolio for my photography to be showcased and the PSD Editor is a community tool that I am working on for my temple.

-  Iâ€™m currently learning and getting a better understanding of Node.js and deepening my knowledge on data structures and algorithms. I will also be sharpening up my python skills in the near future.
